# DAY 1 Practical - Genetic variation and population genetics: central terms and concepts

### FOCUS and LEARNING GOALS
> The aim for this session is for you to 1) become familar with central terms and concepts related to genetic variation and population genetics, 2) use the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium law to estimate allele frequencies and genotype distributions, and assess whether an observed biallelic SNP is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or not, 3) estimate haplotype frequencies from allele frequencies under linkage equilibrium, calculate the linkage disequilibrium coefficient and 4) to get to know the HUNT-Cloud environment.
